# Copilot Instructions

<!-- Synced section ------------------------------------------------------
	This file plus the shared files under `.github/instructions/` are kept
	aligned across f2calv .NET repositories. The repo-specific
	"Project-Specific Overrides" section below is excluded from sync.
	Edit once, sync everywhere.
	------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

## Instruction Files

Detailed conventions live in scoped instruction files under `.github/instructions/`, auto-applied by file type:

| File | Applies to | Covers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `csharp.instructions.md` | `**/*.cs` | C# / .NET style, XML docs, logging, performance, Web API |
| `csharp.testing.instructions.md` | `**/*Tests/**/*.cs` | xUnit test structure, naming, theories, assertions |
| `dotnet.instructions.md` | `**/*.csproj`, `*.slnx`, `Directory.*.props` | Central build/package config, solution format, SDK selection |
| `github-actions.instructions.md` | workflows / `action.yml` | GitHub Actions naming, YAML, security, GitVersion |
| `bash.instructions.md` | `**/*.sh` | Bash scripting structure, error handling, logging, testability |
| `documentation.instructions.md` | `**/*.md` | README consistency and Mermaid diagrams |
| `configuration.instructions.md` | `**/appsettings*.json` | Options/appsettings synchronization and secret safety |

The conventions below always apply, regardless of the file being edited.

## Copilot Workflow

- **Test execution**: Never run tests automatically; integration tests require a registered Signal account and a running signal-cli REST API. Always prompt (ideally with a visual yes/no button) before running any tests.
- **Preserve git history during renames/moves**: When renaming or relocating files, first perform the rename/move (preferably via `git mv`), then make content edits to the file at its new path. Do not delete and recreate files when a rename or move is intended.
- **Multi-repo commits**: When a single change spans multiple repositories, separate per-repository commit messages are acceptable (but not mandatory). Prefer them where the changes are disconnected, or where one repository should not know about the other.
- **Build after refactoring**: After any refactoring, build the entire solution (not only the affected project) to catch compilation errors in dependent projects. When multiple solutions exist, prefer `CasCap.Api.SignalCli.Debug.slnx`.

## Public Repository Confidentiality

- Treat every non-public repository's identity and contents as confidential, even when they appear in the local workspace, conversation context, diffs, logs, or tool output.
- Never publish private repository names, URLs, owner/repository coordinates, branches, file paths, architecture, deployment details, or inferred existence in tracked files, commit messages, issues, pull request titles/descriptions/reviews/comments, release notes, workflow annotations, examples, or other public-facing content.
- Describe required relationships generically (for example, "private GitOps repository" or "internal service") and supply private coordinates only through secrets, repository variables, or caller-provided values.
- Before creating or updating public GitHub content, review the proposed text and metadata for private identifiers and implementation details.

## Repository Structure

Every f2calv repository follows a consistent layout, regardless of language:

- Root files include `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `GitVersion.yml`, `.editorconfig`, `.gitattributes`, `.gitignore`, and `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
- Source code lives under `src/`; runnable examples live under `samples/`.
- Tooling lives in dot-prefixed folders such as `.github/`, `.scripts/`, `.devcontainer/`, `.docker/`, `.config/`, and `.vscode/`.
- Additional documentation beyond the root `README.md` lives as Markdown under `docs/`.
- `.editorconfig` is the source of truth for indentation, line endings, and analyzer or formatting rules.
- `GitVersion.yml` in the root drives semantic-versioning rules.

## Miscellaneous

- When detecting new conventions or patterns, add them to the appropriate `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` file (or this file for cross-cutting workflow rules) and apply them retroactively where applicable.
- Keep this file and the shared `.github/instructions/` files aligned with the common guidelines used by sibling .NET repositories.

## Project-Specific Overrides

### Repository Purpose

This repository contains the .NET client and ASP.NET Core integration packages for the signal-cli REST API, with unit and integration tests and a Generic Host sample.

### Signal Privacy

Beyond the general secret-redaction rule in `csharp.instructions.md`, never log Signal phone numbers, sender or recipient identities, group membership, message content, attachments, Basic Auth credentials, or registration data.

The same applies to CI and test output. Use synthetic E.164 numbers in tracked configuration and examples.
